	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		 Most games made with RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 make use of the so called "Run-Time Package" (RTP), which is a media resources library containing graphics, music and sounds, designed for the common usage of materials. Parts of these data files are often a game dependency, but not included with the game. The RTP data is not free, we need a free (as in freedom) replacement to guarantee the free distribution (if the rest of the game data is free), compatibility and execution of these games.
