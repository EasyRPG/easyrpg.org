## Translators

Currently, only the Android port of EasyRPG Player has proper translation support.

You can translate the strings to your native language online or download them for
offline translation over at our [Weblate] instance, then submit it to us.  
You can do so through Weblate (preferred) or create a pull request for the raw
'strings.xml' file over at GitHub.

There are no additional texts ready and pending to be translated currently,
but there will be later, for example for this information website or for
EasyRPG Editor. Please come back later.
