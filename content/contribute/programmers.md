## Programmers

If you have programming skills, you can contribute code for the project.
<br>
You can ask in our [chat room](/contact/irc/) to meet developer team members
there until this page is being filled.

Also, read the [development wiki pages] to setup the environment and `README`
files from the [source code repositories] at GitHub for every project you are
interested in.
