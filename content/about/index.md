## Introduction
<span id="introduction"></span><!-- icon -->

EasyRPG is a project that aims to create a free (as in freedom) cross-platform
and multi-language Role Playing Game (RPG) creation tool, inspired by
a commercial product called RPG Maker.

The project is composed of several parts:

- [EasyRPG Player](/player/)
- [RTP Replacement](/rtp-replacement/)
- [Tools](/tools/)
- [EasyRPG Editor](/editor/)

## Main goals
<span id="goals"></span><!-- icon -->

These are our main goals:

- **Free as in freedom**: Every component of the project will be published
  under a free license.
- **Cross-platform**: We want EasyRPG to reach as many platforms as possible.
- **Multi-language**: The more languages are supported, the better.
