For any private communication (and security issues) please send us an E-Mail to **easyrpg easyrpg org** (insert "@" and "." manually).

## Chatroom

We offer three different ways to connect to our chat. They are all bridged together so it doesn't matter what you choose.

- IRC: [#easyrpg @ Libera Chat] ([Web Chat](irc/)). _No registration required_.<br>
  The most retro chat experience. If you only have a few questions we recommend this one.
- Matrix: [#easyrpg:matrix.easyrpg.org]. _Requires a Matrix account_.<br>
  If you want to stay longer give it a try.
- Discord: [Invite Link]. _Requires a Discord account_.<br>
  The favorite chat system among gamers. We do not like it because it is proprietary but you may use it.
