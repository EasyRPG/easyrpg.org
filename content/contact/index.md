## E-Mail

For any private communication (and security issues) please send us an E-Mail to **easyrpg easyrpg org** (insert "@" and "." manually).

## Chatrooms

There are two channels available:

- \#easyrpg is for discussions about the development of EasyRPG Player. Before asking any questions please check [our community](https://community.easyrpg.org) for answers first.
- \#openrtp is about assets for the [OpenRTP project](/contribute/artists).

We offer three different ways to connect to our chat. They are all bridged together so it doesn't matter what you choose.

- IRC: [#easyrpg @ IRC], [#openrtp @ IRC] ([Web Chat for #easyrpg](irc/)). _No registration required_.<br>
  The most retro chat experience. If you only have a few questions we recommend this one.
- Matrix: [#easyrpg:matrix.easyrpg.org], [#openrtp:matrix.easyrpg.org]. _Requires a Matrix account_.<br>
  If you want to stay longer give it a try. It is open source software. We love open source!
- Discord: [Invite Link]. _Requires a Discord account_.<br>
  The favorite chat system among gamers. We do not like it because it is proprietary but you may use it.
