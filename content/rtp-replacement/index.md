## Overview

Most games made with RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 make use of the so called
"Run-Time Package" (RTP), which is a media resources library containing graphics,
music and sounds, designed for the common usage of materials. Parts of these
data files are often a game dependency, but not included with the game.
The RTP data is not free, we need a free (as in freedom) replacement to
guarantee the free distribution (if the rest of the game data is free),
compatibility and execution of these games.
