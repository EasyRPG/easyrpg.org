## Our software (Player, Editor, Tools, liblcf and OpenRTP)

Our software does not access the internet. All data is stored locally and never automatically transferred to us. We collect no telemetry etc.

When reporting bugs we will ask you to submit some of this data manually.

When you report a bug we ask you to submit the log file (``easyrpg_log.txt``) and the savegames (``SaveXX.lsd``). The log file contains information about the execution of the engine and does not contain any personal data. The savegames do not normally contain any personal data. Some games will ask you for personal data such as your name. This data is then available in the savegame.

When EasyRPG Player crashes under Windows, a memory dump (``dmp``) is created. This can contain personal data such as your Windows username and other applications running on your system.

The typical way to report a bug is through GitHub. By using GitHub you agree to the [GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). Alternatively, you can email us. If you use the Android Bug Report function, the log file and your savegames will be attached automatically.

When you e-mail us you agree that we use your e-mail address for communicating with you.
