## Chatroom

We offer three different ways to connect to our chat. They are all bridged together so it doesn't matter what you choose.

- IRC: [#easyrpg @ Libera Chat](ircs://irc.libera.chat/easyrpg "#easyrpg IRC") ([Web Chat](/contact/irc "Web Chat")). _No registration required_. The most retro chat experience. If you only have a few questions we recommend this one.
- Matrix: [#easyrpg:matrix.easyrpg.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/%23easyrpg:matrix.easyrpg.org "Matrix Chat"). _Requires a Matrix account_. If you want to stay longer give it a try.
- Discord: [Invite Link](https://discord.com/invite/NrC8yGCgqj "Discord Chat"). _Requires a Discord account_. The favorite chat system among gamers. We do not like it because it is proprietary but you may use it.
